<body>
    <!-- Here are mostly simple tags, <h1> is a heading tag making the text larger. <br> is page break, it adds a new line. 
    <input> is the tag for various input elements. The "type" attribute on the input elements tell the browser what type of thing
    goes there. The "id" attribute is how we will find that element when we search the DOM later. Lastly, the button
    element is the button to click and submit the data. <button> has an "onclick" attribute which indicates what behavior
    is invoked when clicked. In this case it invokes the getTasksForUser() method.   -->
